          <p class="mb-3">Haha see what I did there? So yeah we broke up. Sorry for crying in front of you, I was just pretty sad for some weird reason. All jokes aside, even though we're no longer together, I know
              that you are going to do great things, and I'll still be supporting you from a distance. If you ever need anything at all, I'm 100% here for you. And I want you to know I fully understand now why you broke up with me. It was confusing at First
              because I was just very emotional, but as I've had time to clear my head I have realized that you're right. It wasn't the right time, and if you don't want a relationship, no matter what I could've done, we would still be here. 
              Thank you for being one of the (if not THE) best parts of my life for 2 years. I'm going to leave you alone for now, only occasionally reaching out as a friend. But I can almost guarantee I'll try to win you back
              in the future. I'm not sure when, but I know there is nobody else quite like you. You're amazing, and if anybody tells you otherwise, I'll beat them up. 
              Finally, I know it's kind of sad, but it's also kind of funny now looking back at this essay I wrote about us. I still believe it's 100% accurate, but it's just sad thinking about the stuff in it and reading it now. If you want to read it again
              just click the button. Go live an amazing life, and don't be scared to reach out or even hang out with me every so often. I know I would love it. And I'll always love you, even if not in the same way as before.
